# About
The repository contains a **Typst template** for a "_Diplomarbeit_" / "_Masterarbeit_" / "_Master thesis_" at the **Medical University of Vienna** (Meduni Wien).
[Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) is a typesetting system, offering a fun alternative to LaTeX.  

The template should follow all guidelines outlined in [Leitfaden](https://ub.meduniwien.ac.at/fileadmin/content/OE/ub/dokumente/Leitfaden_Studierende_Hochschulschriften_MedUni_Wien.pdf) provided by the Medical University of Vienna. Even though the template automates most necessary things, allowing you to concentrate on writing the thesis, I still recommend skimming the document before starting to get an overview of all requirements.

# Known issues
1. The template is only designed around writing the thesis is English. This can be easily changed by editing the template. If you do the work a PR would be appreciated :).
